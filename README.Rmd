The goal of officerExtras is to provide helper and convenience functions for the [{officer}](https://github.com/davidgohel/officer) package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of officerExtras like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("elipousson/officerExtras")
```

## Usage

The officerExtras package provides a variety of helper functions to simplify the process of working with officer. For example, a single `read_officer()` function works with docx, pptx, or xlsx files:

```{r read_officer}
library(officerExtras)

docx <- read_officer(filename = "example.docx", path = system.file("doc_examples", package = "officer"))

pptx <- read_officer(filename = "example.pptx", path = system.file("doc_examples", package = "officer"))
```

officer uses a print method to save rdocx, rpptx, or rxlsx objects back to files. officerExtras provides a `write_officer()` with that adds the option to pass a filename and path separately and pass document properties to `officer::doc_properties()`.

```{r write_officer}
withr::with_tempdir({
  write_officer(docx, "write-example.docx", modified_by = "officerExtras", title = "Document Title set by doc_properties", subject = "Microsoft Word, R")

  example_docx <- read_officer("write-example.docx")

  officer::doc_properties(example_docx)
})
```

The package also wraps useful functions from a few other packages.  `convert_docx()` uses `rmarkdown::pandoc_convert()` to convert a rdocx object or a Word document to any other pandoc supported output format:

```{r convert_docx}
convert_docx(docx, to = "markdown")
```
