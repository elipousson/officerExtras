\title{Summarize a rdocx or rpptx object}
\usage{
officer_summary(
  x,
  summary_type = "doc",
  index = NULL,
  preserve = FALSE,
  call = caller_env()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A rdocx or rpptx object passed to \code{\link[officer:docx_summary]{officer::docx_summary()}},
\code{\link[officer:pptx_summary]{officer::pptx_summary()}}, \code{\link[officer:slide_summary]{officer::slide_summary()}}, or
\code{\link[officer:layout_summary]{officer::layout_summary()}}. If x is a data.frame created with one of those
functions, it is returned as is.}

\item{summary_type}{Summary type. Options "doc", "docx", "pptx", "slide", or
"layout". "doc" requires the data.frame include a "content_type" column but
allows columns for either a docx or pptx summary.}

\item{index}{slide index}

\item{preserve}{If \code{FALSE} (default), text in table cells is collapsed into a
single line. If \code{TRUE}, line breaks in table cells are preserved as a "\\n"
character. This feature is adapted from \code{docxtractr::docx_extract_tbl()}
published under a \href{https://github.com/hrbrmstr/docxtractr/blob/master/LICENSE}{MIT licensed} in
the \code{{docxtractr}} package by Bob Rudis.}

\item{call}{The execution environment of a currently running
function, e.g. \code{call = caller_env()}. The corresponding function
call is retrieved and mentioned in error messages as the source
of the error.

You only need to supply \code{call} when throwing a condition from a
helper function which wouldn't be relevant to mention in the
message.

Can also be \code{NULL} or a \link[rlang:topic-defuse]{defused function call} to
respectively not display any call or hard-code a code to display.

For more information about error calls, see \ifelse{html}{\link[rlang:topic-error-call]{Including function calls in error messages}}{\link[rlang:topic-error-call]{Including function calls in error messages}}.}
}
\value{
A data frame object.
}
\description{
The preserve parameter is supported by officer version >= 0.6.3 (currently
the development version) and it is ignored unless a minimum supported version
of officer is installed.
